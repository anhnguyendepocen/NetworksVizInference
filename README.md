#NetworksVizInference

A repository for all the things relating to visual inference and model diagnostics on network models. 

## Outline

1. Motivation and Visual inference Intro
2. Define "visual" effects 
3. Model Diagnostics - what we want to do
4. Set up and describe online experiments 
5. Discuss and analyze experiment results
6. Draw conclusions

Other notes: 

- need a lot of data 
- need a lot of significant models
- currently working on an R package to pull this all together. This might mean another repo -- sorry.
