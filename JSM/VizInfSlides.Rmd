# Introduction

## Visual Inference 

## Lineup (?)


## SAOMs

Goal: modeling dynamic networks using 

- Network effects (e.g. outdegree, reciprocity)
- Actor covariate effects 

## Model "Rules"

Observed networks treated as discrete observations of a continuous time Markov Chain. 

1. At each (unobserved) time point in the CTMC one actor can change one of its ties.
2. Between network observations (say from $t_1$ to $t_2$) all actors are given the opportunity to change a tie at the same rate.
3. Once an actor can change, it tries to maximize its objective functon, $f_i(x)$
